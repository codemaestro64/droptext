# Droptext

A self-hosted web application for sharing and publishing plain text or code snippets, built with Next.js. Droptext allows users to quickly upload text or code, generate a shareable link, and distribute it to others. This project is ideal for developers, writers, or anyone seeking a straightforward and efficient way to share text-based content without the clutter of traditional communication platforms.

## Features

- **Simple Text Sharing**: Paste text or code into a form and instantly generate a shareable link.
- **Next.js Powered**: Leverages the power of Next.js for fast, server-side rendered pages and a seamless development experience.
- **Font Optimization**: Utilizes the next/font feature to automatically optimize and load the Geist font family for a modern, clean look.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Uses `make` to abstract `npm` commands for simplified development workflows.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Easily deployable on the Vercel Platform for scalable hosting.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 18.x or higher recommended).
- **Make**: Ensure `make` is installed on your system to use the abstracted commands.
- **Git**: Required to clone the repository.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codemaestro64/droptext.git
   cd droptext
   ```

2. **Generate Environment File**: Before the first run, create the environment file using:

   ```bash
   make generate-env
   ```

   This will prompt you to enter values for the required environment variables (e.g., database connection details, etc.). The command generates a `.env` file based on your input. Update the `.env` file manually if additional configuration is needed.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

4. **Migrate Database Schema**: Apply the database schema migrations with:

   ```bash
   make db-migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

### Project Structure

- `app/page.tsx`: The main entry point for the application. Edit this file to modify the homepage.
- `Makefile`: Contains abstracted commands for managing the project (e.g., `install`, `dev`, `generate-env`, `db-migrate`).
- `.env`: Environment configuration file generated by `make generate-env` with user-provided values.

## Usage

1. **Create a Snippet**:

   - Navigate to the homepage (`http://localhost:3000`).
   - Paste your text or code into the provided form.
   - Click the "Publish" button to generate a unique, shareable link.

2. **Share the Link**:

   - Copy the generated link and share it with others.
   - Recipients can view the text or code directly in their browser.

3. **Edit Content**:

   - Modify `app/page.tsx` to customize the UI or add new features, such as syntax highlighting or expiration dates for snippets.

## Deployment

Deploying Droptext is straightforward with the Vercel Platform, which is optimized for Next.js applications.

### Deploying on Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your repository is pushed to GitHub (`https://github.com/codemaestro64/droptext`).

2. **Connect to Vercel**:

   - Sign in to Vercel.
   - Import your repository from GitHub.
   - Follow the prompts to configure and deploy your project.

3. **Configure Environment**:

   - Add the environment variables from your `.env` file to Vercel's environment settings.
   - Ensure the database migration step (`make db-migrate`) is handled in your deployment pipeline or manually before deployment.

4. **Access Your Deployed App**: Once deployed, Vercel provides a unique URL (e.g., `https://droptext.vercel.app`) for your application.

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the Next.js deployment documentation.
